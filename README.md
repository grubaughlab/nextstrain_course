# Nextstrain course

This repository contains the essential files for creating a [nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/) for running and visualizing phylogeographic analyses of pathogen spread using genomic data.

Keep the **Author** and **License** sections, and edit the rest of this README file as you wish, creating a description of your project using the [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), with topics and subtopics.

## Getting started

### For windows users

Native Linux and Mac Users are all set, and can move on to the next step below. Windows users, however, must install a Linux subsystem before being able to install nextstrain. Access [this link](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/windows-help) for a step-by-step guide about how to [setup Linux on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (please choose 'Ubuntu 18.04 LTS'), and how to launch Linux and [create a user account and password](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro) on command line.

### Learning basic UNIX commands

Familiarize yourself with basic UNIX commands for navigating and managing files and folders in a command line interface (Terminal). In this environment you can perform all simple tasks you usually do using mouse clicks: copy, move, delete, access, and create files and folders. All you need to do is to type a few commands. Below you can find the main commands required to operate in a Terminal. Please access [this page]() to learn a few more commands and practice their use.

ls → list files and folders | mkdir folderX → create folderX | cd folderX → move into folderX
rm → remove files/folders | cd ../ → go back to previous folder | mv → move files/folder to another place
pwd → check you current directory | head → see the first 10 lines of a file | head → see the last 10 lines of a file

### Installing nextstrain

Refer to the original [nextstrain page](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/local-installation) for instructions on how to install `augur` (bioinformatics pipeline) and `auspice` (visualization tool).
